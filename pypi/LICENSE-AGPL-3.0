LICENSE-AGPL-3.0 (Placeholder)

Replace this file with the FULL, OFFICIAL text of the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0.
You can obtain it from the Free Software Foundation (FSF).

Notes:
- Keep the text UNMODIFIED.
- Your repository should include this file at the top level.
- Reference this file from package manifests (Cargo.toml license-file, pyproject.toml license file).

Until you replace this placeholder, your repository is missing the authoritative AGPL license text.
